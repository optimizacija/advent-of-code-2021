# Advent of Code 2021 Rust Solutions 

Hi, this repo contains my [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) solutions written in Rust.
The point of this project was to learn Rust from the *grounds up* & have some fun along the way.

My solutions are by no means the fastest ones out there. I wanted to do my own research and come up with fresh ideas that work for me.
It took me bit under 2 months to complete all of the 50 tasks in my spare time during the [summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_in_July) of 2022.

In the end it took me longer than I expected, but I'm proud that I followed through.
And I'm happy that I can share this with **you** and the rest of open source community. Enjoy!
