# Advent of Code 2021 Rust Solutions 

Hi! This repo contains solutions to all 50 [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles.
The goal of the project was to learn Rust from the *grounds up* & have some fun along the way.

Code that I provide is by no means the fastest one out there. There are many more efficient implementations on the internet.
I wanted to arrive to conclusions based on my own research, ideas and effort.

In total, it took me bit under 2 months of work in my spare time during the [summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_in_July) months of 2022.
Indeed, a bit more than I expected, but I followed through and I am proud of the final product.

Now that it is over, I am happy to share it with you and the rest of open source community. 
I encourage you to give AoC a [shot](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1) if you haven't already and enjoy!

# Running solutions

Each solution is its own Rust project. So, just cd into the respective directory and run cargo in release mode.

```zsh
cd day01_part1/
cargo run --release
```

You can also try them out with your input, by replacing the contents of the respective `data.in` files with your data.

I started looking into branching off from Typescript development into Rust programming. 
I am a lifelong learner and diving into the unknown is my one true passion. Socrates once said,
